* [RTalk Podcast](http://rtalk.org/): I co-host a "semi-infrequent" podcast on the statistical software and programming language R with some buddies in the community. 

* [dumas: My personal R package](https://github.com/jasdumas/dumas): My vanity R package filled with useful functions for analysis and R development.

* [shinyGEO](http://jasdumas.github.io/shinyGEO/): The Gene Expression Omnibus Analysis with Shiny (Project Name: GEO-AWS) is a web application to download gene expression datasets from the GEO Repository and perform differential expression and survival analyses. This project was partially development as part of the [2015 Google Summer of Code program](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/jasdumas/5668600916475904). 

* [Tutorial: Web scraping and mapping breweries with import.io and R](http://trendct.org/2016/03/18/tutorial-web-scraping-and-mapping-breweries-with-import-io-and-r/): Getting information on Breweries can be a difficult process with data from multiple sources or sources that have limited access to developers. Import.io instantly turns webpages into data with minimal or no set-up involved. I used this to extract meta information on Connecticut-based breweries. 

* [Insurance Claim Complaints](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/eda-ct-insurance): Exploratory Data Analysis of CT Insurance Company Complaints, Resolutions, Status, and Recoveries from an open dataset from https://data.ct.gov

* [Connecticut Real estate](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/ct-realestate): Linear model building and analysis of Connecticut real estate sales from 2011 to 2013 from https://data.ct.gov

* [Virtual Bioinformatics Notebook](https://github.com/jasdumas/DouglasFir): I spent a few great months gain informatics skills at the University of Connecticut (UCONN) working on the genomics of big trees. :deciduous_tree:

* [Feasibility of an electronic stethoscope system for monitoring neonatal bowel sounds.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24156174): A publication from my Undergraduate research in neonatal medical devices for detecting and monitoring bowel sounds in premature infants. 2013

* [My soloved Project Euler problems](https://github.com/jasdumas/LeonhardEuler): For fun I like to stretch my mathematical and python knowledge and attempt to solve these famous problems.

* [Star Wars 2048 Game](http://jasdumas.github.io/2048/): This project involved conceptualizing a re-design for the popular web application game 2048. In my version I gave it a much needed Star Wars upgrade where the objective is to achieve the highest square of Yoda!
